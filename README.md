# Handwriting Distinguisher
## Context
This project serves as our final project for the CS410/510 - Intro to Visual Computing course at Portland State University during the spring 2025 quarter.
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop and train a neural network model to be able to distinguish between different handwriting styles and match them to the name of the person who writes in a given style. The neural network will be trained on handwriting samples provided by the 4 collaborators within the [dataset](dataset/) directory.
